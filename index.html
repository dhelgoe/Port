        <h3>Project 6</h3>

        <p>The purpose of this application is to provide real-time news and weather information to our end user. We wanted to create a user friendly, one-stop web application that could deliver news and weather to a user anywhere in the world! I mainly worked with the API's and worked with my partners on making sure they worked properly. The weather API no longer works but you can see in the photo above the final product!</p>
